Basic Checklist<br/>
    *Set up db in MySQL workbench(local instance 3306), Set up project with both the client folders (templates, static, etc.) and the server files (server.py, mySQLconnection.py, etc.), a readMe File, and commit to GitHub.<br/>
    *Set up Backend. What functionality to I want the app to have? What functions can I see having to be reused a lot? What would that look like in code? How can I create Classes to help make reusing the code easier? How can check my code for errors as I am writing? <br/>
    *Set up Front-End? How will the client interact with the page? How do I plug my Back-End logic into the page? How do I want my Routes set up? Once the client has provided information, how do I validate it? Once it's validated, how do I send client-information to the database? How do I allow a client to see requested information from the database?
